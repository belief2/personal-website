    <p class="story"> My name is Mary Otero. I am originally from South America. I was born in Venezuela and raised in Colombia.
        In 2004, my family and I moved to the United States. Since then, this diverse and welcoming country has become
        our cherished home. I am fluent in English and Spanish, but my core language is music. I have a deep passion for
        music and the arts. Playing instruments and dancing are my way of expressing the rhythms of life. I am
        passionately pursuing a career as a FullStack Web Developer. I am on a mission to combine my love for creation
        with my fascination for logical problem-solving, creating
        complete web experiences from start to finish. With over a decade of dedicated service in customer-oriented
        roles, I have developed a robust skill set in customer care, time management, multitasking, and problem-solving.
        9+ years in Tutoring and Teaching have led to developing active listening, communication, and adaptability
        skills. I have a strong passion for web development. I am interested in using my abilities to excel in this
        field.
